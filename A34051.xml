         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore I do here tender to your Lordſhip a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> upon the nobleſt of Duties, <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the life of that Duty, <hi>Devotion,</hi> and the beſt Rule of humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure for the Exerciſe thereof, <hi>the

So that I am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to believe it cannot be more my delight to behold your Lordſhips name grace theſe Pages, then it will be your ſatisfaction that any thing which is yours may ſerve to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Concerns of <hi>Piety</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> to which your Lordſhip hath ever expreſſed ſo rare a Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For tis not alone the Honours, but the virtues of your noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors (famous upon record for their affections to <hi>Religion</hi>) which your
<pb facs="tcp:46235:5"/> Lordſhip doth inherit; which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations cannot but endear any deſign to illuſtrate and vindicate thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> in the defence of which your Lordſhips ſword hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and in the practiſe whereof your Soul is daily poured out at the Throne of Grace. So that I do with much cheerfulneſs preſent this little <hi>Tract</hi> as a daily ſervant to your Lordſhip and of continual uſe in your converſe with <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it may be both pleaſant as it ſimpathiſes with your wel-grounded Principles, and profitable by adding wings to your Petitions, and caſting oile on the flames of your daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

                  <p>OH my ſoul, what fearful tremblings are theſe have ſeized on thee, ſo that the thoughts of God that have been and ought to be thy greateſt comfort, are now become thy terrour and amazement! Whence is this miſerable alteration, that thou canſt behold nothing but Judgment in the Father of Mercies, and Anger in the Fountain of Love? What hath provoked him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to ſpare to be reſolved to puniſh? Surely my ſins are very many, for it is not a few can incenſe him, and they have more then ordinary aggravations: for he is not ſo highly diſpleaſed at ſmall offences, and certainly I have often committed them, and long continued in them, for he begins not to frown upon the firſt misdemeanor: Alas, the caſe is too apparent! My ſins are both very many and exceeding great, frequently repeated and of long continuance. I have deſpiſed Mercy, and now I am likely to feel Judgment. Miſerable wretch that I am, I have tyred out the patience of a long-ſuffering Father, and run from the embraces of a loving Saviour, rejected the offers of a moſt indulgent holy Spirit, ſo that now I fear I have ſtopped up the fountain of his Mercy<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2.</note> and unſealed the treaſures of his vengeance<note n="(u)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.34.</note>. And I ought rather to wonder how God could ſpare me ſo long, then why he ſhould ſtrike me now, ſince many have been cut off for fewer and leſſer ſins: I ſee I have moſt juſtly deſerved to ſuffer the worſt of evils, and therefore ſhould eſteem it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable favour to be onely corrected with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affliction, if I might be ſo excuſed: But it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fall into the hands of the living God<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.31.</note>, who I fear will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by theſe and increaſe them, till I be ruined by them, and drop into a ſad eternity. Therefore, O Lord, <hi>my fleſh trembleth for fear of thee,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46235:29"/> and I am afraid of thy Judgments</hi>

To be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is impoſſible, to be found intollerable, I am miſerably confounded. But was never any in this caſe before, that I might receive ſome adviſe and comfort for them? Yes ſurely, The Church hath here preſented me with a King and a Prophet, both dear to God, whoſe fears were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though their ſins were leſs, and their danger not ſo great as mine; yet theſe in the midſt of their fears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their ſins as the onely cauſe of theſe evils, and accordingly, they freely confeſſed them, bitterly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and exceedingly humbled themſelves for them; not ſtriving ſo much to avoid the Puniſhment, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardon of their ſins, knowing that the guilt once removed, thou wouldſt either totally ſpare them, or gently chaſtiſe them for their good. Wherefore they rendred themſelves up into thy hands, rather aggravating then extenuating their offences, and yet humbly begging their correction might be in mercy, and they found the benefit of it. Go to then my ſoul, and do thou likewiſe; thou haſt firſt occaſioned Gods wrath by thy breaches of his laws, oh do not encreaſe it by diſhonouring his Name with exceſſive fears! thou haſt forſaken him by ſin, run not farther by deſpair; for the faſter thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt from his Mercy, the ſooner thou wilt meet with his Juſtice. Delay no longer, but go in before he ſend for thee, deliver up thy ſelf before death or any ſore judgment arreſt thee; accuſe thy ſelf before thou be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and confeſs thy ſins freely before the witneſſes be called out againſt thee; paſs ſentence on thy ſelf e're the Judge condemn thee. I cannot expect wholly to eſcape, but it will be a great favour if I meet a ſickneſs inſtead of death; loſſes in my eſtate, inſtead of looſing both my God and my Soul for ever. It is not fit to deſire my heavenly Father altogether to lay aſide his Rod, but only to uſe it gently that I may by this ſmart be warned againſt thoſe future ſins that bring me to utter and final ruine; Oh Lord, rather chaſtiſe me then diſinherit me,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46235:30"/> me, and thoſe ſtripes ſhall be welcome which come in exchange for eternal torments. Thou who wilt change thy Sword into a Rod, wilt be ſo compaſſionate in thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that I ſhall onely feel what my diſtempered ſoul needs to recover, and my fleſh and ſpirit can bear not what my ſins deſerve, and thy Juſtice might exact: Wherefore I will no longer hide my ſins, but by a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty confeſſion declare that I hate them more then I fear to fall into thy merciful hands, and do hope hereafter I ſhall fear to offend, and then I ſhall be freed from theſe ſad expectations of thy heavy wrath, which wiſdom God grant me for Jeſus ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

I am told nothing is more acceptable then a broken heart, tis ſtrange! can an heart polluted with the guilt and enſlaved to the Power of ſin, ſtupid to apprehend, ſlow to deſire, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to wait for and unable to perform any good; but witty to invent and vigorous to proſecute, unſatiable to deſire, and unwearied to purſue all evil, and now more vile then ever, by reflecting upon its own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhaken with fears torn in pieces with ſorrow, and even a terror to it ſelf, miſerable and poor, blind and naked, can this heart be a fit ſacrifice for ſo glorious and all-ſeeing, ſo holy and pure a God, can he like that which I abhor, how can it be? but let me recall that haſty word; for he hath ſaid it, who beſt knows what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46235:33"/> will pleaſe himſelf, and if he value it, it is worthy, for the true worth of every thing is to be judged by his eſtimation of it: Who knows but ſuch a broken heart may be a greater evidence of his power and mercy, a fitter inſtrument of his praiſe and glory, a plainer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcribe his grace and draw his image on then any other? Such a heart I have, and if this ſerve I am happy, I will give it freely to thee, oh Lord! who deſpiſeſt not the meaneſt gift if there be ſincerity in the giver. It was broken before with fear but it is now diſſolved with love, I am aſhamed it is no better, but thy mercy is the greater in accepting it, and it will become better by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine: oh how am I filled with admiration of the freeneſs and fulneſs of thy mercies in compariſon of which the greateſt humane compaſſion ſeems cruelty, and I dare proclaim to all, that in thee are all the mercies of the world united, and thou art mercy it ſelf in the higheſt degree, if my diſobedience and negligence, contempt and ingratitude could have ſeparated thee from thy mercy, I had now met thee in fury taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance without pitty, for I have ſeemed to live as if I had deſigned to Dare thee to turn away thy ſelf from me, and to try thy utmoſt patience, the leaſt part of which baſeneſs would have turned my beſt friends in the world againſt me; but behold the mercy of my God continues ſtill! oh let me have the ſhame of an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinner! and thy name have the glory of thy inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible pitty, even to thoſe who are almoſt aſhamed to ask pardon, and let me to whom thou haſt ſhewed ſuch compaſſion, have the honour to be an inſtance of thy goodneſs to all the world; but have I ſuch a father, why then do I lye ſtill with this load of guilt upon my ſoul, and this heavy burden of ſorrow upon my ſpirit, what do I get by theſe vain complaints, but waſte my time and double my miſery by ſad reflections; I can neither have help from my ſelf nor any creature, but from my Father alone, to whom mercies are as proper as miſery is to me, and if I through fear or ſorrow ſit ſtill here and ſtarve, I have not ſo much pity for my ſelf as he would have for me if he ſaw me thus grieved for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46235:34"/> abuſing his mercies; wherefore I will ariſe and go though I think I ſhall ſcarce have the face to ask more I have ſpent the laſt ſo ill, and I ſhall be aſhamed to tell him how baſe I have been: but as I was not aſhamed when I did evil, ſo I muſt have ſhame when I ſuffer the deſert of it, I will go bathed in tears, bluſhing for ſhame, accuſing my ſelf and only relying on the bowels of a Father, will beg only ſo much mercy as will ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh deſpair and quiet my mind and give me ſome little hope, and revive my languiſhing faith, and if I may have this I will be content, though I be not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with aſſurance and certain expectations, for the leaſt favourable look is more then I have deſerved: yet I ſee the tender Father upon the firſt ſight of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning prodigal whom he had never ſent for, but was driven home by his own miſeries, yet he runs to meet him, takes the words out of his mouth, and receives him with all the demonſtrations of love and the careſſes of a deer affection: and is my God leſs merciful who hath invited me ſo often, and promiſed me ſo largely; I have done ill to ſtay ſo long; but I will go now high in my deſires, low in my expectations ſorrowing for my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and begging his mercy, and I hope though I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no merits of my own to his juſtice, yet I carry mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery enough to make his bowels of compaſſion yearn upon me and then I cannot periſh.

Bleſſed be thy Name, I now ſee I have been ſtraying from thee the fountain of all true happineſs, and have been in vain ſeeking content where it is not to be found, and this diſappointment drives me to ſeek it where it is. Had I not been a ſtranger to my own heart, I had not been ſo far out of the right way: But I have ſuppoſed my ſelf clear, only becauſe I never conſidered wherein I was guilty, and have flattered my ſelf with the pleaſing thoughts of my own innocence, ſo that I have been as ſecure, as if I really had been ſo: I have relyed on my own vain imaginations, being glad to ſpare my ſelf the labour of a farther inquiry, and moſt fooliſhly I have accounted this a Peace, which was no other but want of a ſenſe of my real danger. I find my chief deſign hath been to ſeem good, and perſuade my ſelf I was ſo, that I might be more quiet in the ways of evil, and might neither be accuſed by my own Conſcience, nor allarum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thy dreadful threatnings, ſince I ſuppoſed they did not belong to me. But alas, how miſerable would the event of this ſelf deceit have been; for thou, oh my God, didſt ſee, and wouldſt have condemned me for all my blaſphemous and repining thoughts againſt thee; my malicious, envious, diſdainful and treacherous thoughts againſt my neighbour: thou heardeſt all thoſe falſe and ſlanderous vain and filthy words I uttered with my mouth: thoſe deceitful and unjuſt, cruel and uncharitable works which I committed with my hands thou ſaweſt: yea, all that formality and hypocriſie, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and pride, luſt and covetouſneſs that lay in the ſecret corners of my heart, were apparent in thy ſight; and what did it avail me not to ſee them? thy vengeance would have come as certainly, and more terribly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

It is moſt ſtrange I ſhould never ſee this vaſt heap before; but ſure I have wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhut my eyes, leſt I ſhould diſcern, that I was loath to believe and unwilling to amend: and thus my Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties continue ſtill. But now I ſee them by thy mercy, and I believe I have offended thee as much by hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in concealing them, as by my diſobedience in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them. Therefore now I will ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, becauſe the graciouſneſs of thy Nature, and the truth of thy Promiſes, and the ſatisfaction of the Lord Jeſus, are ſufficient to procure a pardon for thoſe who dare ſo far truſt to thy Mercy, as to become their own accuſers: and while I thus diſcover my ſore to the Phyſician of ſouls, though it be diſhonourable and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, 'tis the onely way to have it cured and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; had not Jeſus dyed for me upon my confeſſion, thy Juſtice would have proceeded to puniſh, but now by thy promiſe to him, it will oblige thee to forgive me and deliver me: Yet ſince my God hath ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly convinced me of the evil and danger of thoſe courſes I have taken, I will not reſt in a bare confeſſion I am in the wrong; but by his grace will return from it, and utterly forſake all theſe my follies. His Mercy perhaps is great enough to forgive thee upon thy hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment, but that he knows thy ſins are as inconſiſtant with thy happineſs (oh my ſoul!) as they are with his laws; and therefore he that deſires thy felicity, will not forgive the old ſcore, unleſs thou ceaſe to run further in debt, for while thou goeſt on in ſin, thou art in the way to eternal death, and art really dead to all true ſenſe of divine comfort, thou art bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive in luſts and pleaſures, and thy fleſh intombs thy wretched ſoul, and the grave-cloaths of vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions bind thee hand and foot from moving towards God; nor haſt thou power to breathe in the pure air of heavenly meditations, and canſt thou like to ſtay in this filthy place ſtill, when thou didſt not ſee thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no wonder if thou calledſt this Dungeon and Vault a Pallace.

                  <p>IT had been well for my ſoul if all this while my ſafety had been equal to my confidence, for none ever thought themſelves more ſecure, though there was no other ground for it but only becauſe I was reſolved not to take the pains to behold my danger: I have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my tranſgreſſions and lived in ſins unamended yea unrepented of, and therefore have had the drawn ſword of the divine vengeance hanging over my guilty head by the ſlender thred of my uncertain life which every thing can ſnap aſunder, and I have ſeemed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſhut my eyes, chuſing rather to feel it and the eternal ſmart of it, then to behold this dreadful ſight which would long ſince have terrified me into amendment and ſnatched me from under the approaching ruine; what prodigious folly hath ſeized on me? what ſtupid lazineſs hath benummed me? are the pains of eſcaping greater then the pains of ſuffering, or will the blow be lighter becauſe I reſolve neither to ſee it, nor avoid it; awake my ſoul, awake, while there is a poſſibility to prevent thy ruine, thy ſins are ſo numerous and ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that thou canſt be ignorant of them; the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gods wrath are ſo plain and ſo poſitive, that thou mayſt ſee they aim at thee, thy conſcience cryes ſo loud, that thou canſt not but hear it, and Gods holy ſpirit pleads ſo powerfully, that thou muſt take as much pains to exclude theſe friends, as would ſerve to turn out thy enemies; Surely God gave me not wit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to invent a plauſible cover for the eyes of my conſcience, or to contrive bulworks of excuſes to intrench my ſins in ſafety, and yet I unhappy wretch have been ingenious in nothing ſo much as in plotting the ruine of my ſoul, and deſigning to periſh undiſturbed. Behold and bluſh where holy <hi>David</hi> lyes covered with ſhame, drowned in tears, and overwhelmed with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, not able through ſear and terror to take his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46235:40"/> eye of that one offence, whilſt thou a far greater ſinner art careleſs and unconcerned. He ſets his before his own face and God throws them behind his back, but I who caſt them behind me and ſtrive to bury them in oblivion, and inconſideration ſhall have them ſet before my face when the ſight of them cannot conduce to the obtaining of my pardon; but the aggravating my eternal miſery: the ſight of them indeed is moſt unpleaſant, the object odious and ungrateful, but the benefit will abundantly recompence the trouble, and if I behold them now ſo as to repent of them I ſhall ſee them no more for ever. I will imitate therefore this holy man, and ever view the guilt and the danger of them, that I may humbly confeſs them, and obtain a pardon for them: my wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heart hath taken pleaſure in committing them, and it ſhall have vexation in reflecting on them, for I will not take my eyes off from them till the horrid aſpect of my grievous iniquities have humbled my ſoul for them and turned my heart againſt them. The bleſſed Jeſus that ſees the hearts and knows the neceſſities of all, hath given a univerſal command of repentance to all men; which yet methinks ſeems peculiarly directed to me who have neglected this neceſſary duty hitherto. Thou oh Lord ſeeſt my danger and pittieth my approaching ruine, I bow my head and heart, and neither dare nor can diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſo gracious and loving advice, ſo uſeful and neceſſary a warning. Thy bare word had been ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience from thoſe who expect ſalvation by thee, but thou art pleaſed farther to convince me, I do believe dear Jeſus the benefit is great if I ſhall turn now while thy grace is ſo freely offered to all people, I know the danger is dreadful if I defer any longer, ſince 'tis certain thy Kingdome ſhall come, but uncertain how ſoon, either death ſhall arreſt me, or judgment ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me in ſuch delayes, I have cauſe to bleſs thee that neither of theſe have happened yet, ſince I have ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked thee by excluding ſo gracious a King out of my heart, rather then I would be at the trouble of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for thee: yet Lord thou calleſt ſtill, and now I am making what haſte I can, oh remember not how
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46235:41"/> long I have ſtayed, but conſider how little time I have left, and by the help of thy grace make my work ſhort and eaſie, proportionable to my time and ſtrength; I confeſs I knew before, but I never conſidered till now and now I dare not ſtay: but through thy help now I come, oh do not caſt me off for thy mercies ſake.

                  <p>OH my ſoul, thou art ſurely ſeized with a ſtrange diſtemper, which reſiſts the efficacy of the choiceſt remedies! and the plaiſter which cures others doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail me. I confeſs my offences every day upon my bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knees, and yet my faith is weak, my hopes of pardon wavering, my ſenſe of Gods love very ſmall; ſo that I am almoſt tempted to live like thoſe, who are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned whether they ſin or no, becauſe I find no benefit
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46235:42"/> by all my humiliations; and this temptation had prevailed if I had not ſeen that (ſince others receive advantage from theſe means) the fault is in me and not in them, nor in the God I ſerve; he cannot deny his promiſes, falſifie his Word, nor reject thoſe when they come, who came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his courteous Invitation: Oh where is this accurſed thing, that reſtrains Gods mercy, and blaſts my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and puts me upon injurious thoughts againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and atheiſtical reſolutions of totally neglecting theſe holy things. The matter is good for God commands it, the benefit is great, for many have found it. But is it done in a right manner? the failing may be there; Yet I have been careful to kneel reverently, look ſadly, ſigh grievouſly, and tell the Almighty the ſtory of my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life with addreſſes becoming a Penitent: Alas, this comes far ſhort of what God requires, even a broken ſpirit and a contrite heart; and I have been ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeem ſorrowful, that I have not endeavoured really to be ſo. Oh my God, thou that ſearcheſt the heart, thou haſt ſeen my heart untouched in the midſt of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; I have not been ſmitten with a ſenſe of the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of my ſins to thee, nor their danger to me, and therefore I have not fully renounced them, nor yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely returned to thee and thy wayes, and therefore thou haſt not bleſſed my Confeſſions, which have rather been looked on by me as an indulgence to go on (ſince my former offences were ſo eaſily pardoned) then an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to forſake my iniquities: But now I know my vileneſs in making ſo ſlight addreſſes for ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and my ſolly to cheat my ſelf of ſo conſiderable a bleſſing, and my ſloth to ſlip ſo many fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: by my deceitful behaviour before thee, O Lord, I have deceived my ſelf, and I am hugely aſhamed that having offended ſo dear a Father, I have been no more really concerned, and having ſo gracious a God to turn to, I am yet ſo far diſtant from thee, by pretending to turn to thee. If I want pardon or peace, the blame muſt lye upon my own negligence, for thou art apt to give, and ready to forgive long before thou puniſheſt ſinners, but ſoon entreated to receive Penitents, and doeſt moſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46235:43"/> joyfully lay aſide thy reſolutions of judgment, when we perform our purpoſes of amendment: Oh my ſoul, will not this real goodneſs of thy God ſhame thy hypocriſie, will it not pierce thy heart to ſee whom thou haſt offended, and thaw thy hopes to behold whom thou art turning to. His holineſs is mixed with long ſuffering, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with mercy, his decrees allayed with limitations; and is it fit to approach him, without love or fear, hopes or deſires, gratitude or admiration; or is the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo mean a favour, that it deſerves no more hearty applications; ſure enough my hypocriſie hath hindered my pardon, wherefore I begin to deteſt it, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will look more to the diſpoſitions of my heart, then the poſture of my body; I will ſet him before me whoſe love I have abuſed, and whoſe patience I have tyred, who is ſo gracious to ſpare me, and ſo willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to me a moſt ungrateful wretch; that ſo when I come to him I may have my eyes filled with tears, my cheeks with bluſhes, and my heart with ſorrow: I will remember who I am that go, that I may be humble, what I go for, that I may be earneſt, and who I go to, that I may be full of faith and hope, ſo ſhall my addreſſes not be in vain, but all theſe gracious attributes ſhall be made good to me. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Theſe ſins are not againſt the laws of any mortal Prince, but againſt the commands of the King of Kings, the God of Heaven, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us is ſo abſolute, his Wiſdome ſo infinite to enact, and his Power ſo great to reward or puniſh, that <hi>David,</hi> though he was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to no humane tribunal<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Theſe our offences are againſt moſt holy laws, which none of us can plead againſt, that they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unjuſt or unfit, impoſſible or unreaſonable, becauſe our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences teſtify for them, and our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber reaſon approves of them, even when our affections intice us to diſobey them: And if before our Confeſſion we enlarge theſe particulars by a ſerious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will help us to acknowledge more ſorrowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſue more earneſtly, and reſolve more firmly againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>We have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and we have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done.]</hi> The perfect rule which God hath given us, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe us what we ought to do (and thoſe preſcriptions are called the Affirmative Precepts) and alſo forbids us thoſe things which we ought not to do, which are the Negative Precepts<note n="(c)" place="margin">The Jewiſh Rab. number <hi>613</hi> precepts in all (ſo many as there are letters in the Decalogue) of which the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive are <hi>248</hi> (ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the joynts in a mans body) and the Negative <hi>365</hi> (ſo many as there are days in one year).</note>. Now the breach of an Affirmative Precept or leaving a duty undone, is called a Sin of Omiſſion: the breach of a Negative, or doing what ought not to be done, is a ſin of Commiſſion, which two ſorts take in all the ſins that can be committed againſt the Divine law, and is uſed here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is large enough to take in all the crimes of the worſt, and yet it is too ſutable to the actions of the beſt which (if they conſider) will not deny they have often offended in both kinds: It would be tedious to inſert a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Catalogue, and is better done elſewhere<note n="(d)" place="margin">Whole duty of man in the end.</note>, and it is more proper for the cloſet then the Church. Yet ſince there is much deceit in generals, and we may be private between God
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46235:59"/> and our own ſouls even in the Congregation. I ſhall adviſe that before our Confeſſion we call to mind ſome ſins of both ſorts; viz. ſins of Omiſſion, as neglecting or ill performing of the duties of Prayer, Hearing, receiving the Sacraments; as alſo of matters Moral, the omiſſion of Alms, Obedience to our Superiours, Charity to our Brethrens ſouls, together with our deficiency in the Evangelical Graces of Faith, Repentance, Humility and Patience. And alſo that we conſider of our ſins of Commiſſion, ſuch as Atheiſme, Apoſtacy, Blaſphemy, Perjury, Rebellion, Anger and Malice, Luſt with its ſupporters Gluttony and Drunkenneſs: Oppreſſion and Cheating, Lying and Slandering, Envy and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are againſt the Moral Law, together with thoſe againſt the Goſpel and its conſtitutions: And by ſo doing, we ſhall avoid the hypocriſie of obſcuring our particular ſins under a ſlight and general Confeſſion, which can hardly be ſaid with an humble, lowly, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and obedient heart, unleſs we know the particulars and have examined their number, and pondered the heinouſneſs of them: I may add, that of theſe two ſorts the leaſt is enough to condemn us, and yet there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of guilt, and thoſe of Commiſſion are of a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dy; it is worſe to do evil, then to neglect that which is good, becauſe in the firſt there is real miſchief and yet it is eaſier to avoid a ſin, then perform a duty, and that cannot be repared as this may.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46235:75"/> of the daily office: which being ſo uſeful and neceſſary and founded on holy Scripture, needs not any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to defend it, but that the ignorance and prejudice of ſome makes them take offence at it, and principally becauſe it hath been ſo much abuſed by the Papal Church: ſo that it may perhaps help the Devotion of many, if we diſcover the true meaning of Abſolution, and the miſtakes of our adverſaries on both ſides, as well thoſe who make it nothing, as thoſe who urge it as <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> thoſe who would rob us of it, as thoſe who would enſnare us by it. 1. The true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of England concerning Abſolution, may beſt be gathered from the Liturgy; in which are three forms of Abſolving ſet down. The firſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory here, which is a ſolemn promulgation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by a Commiſſionated perſon, repeated every day when the whole Congregation confeſs their ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are aſſured of forgiveneſs if they Repent and believe, and this is fitted for a mixt Company of good and bad men, where many hypocrites feign Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but this Abſolution gives no encouragement to ſuch: Only it aſſures all that there is a Pardon, and ſhews on what terms it may be had, ſo that to thoſe who truly do repent it is preſent remiſſion, to thoſe that do not it is a Monitor that they may repent, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the Godly, and allows not the wicked to preſume, no nor yet to deſpair; and this being pronounced to all the people, every one is to take his Portion. The ſecond form is Petitionary in the Communion Service, where the Miniſter lays down the Promiſe, and on that ground, by vertue of his office, begs of God to make that promiſe good, and this is more then the Prayer of another Perſon, becauſe God having ſent the Miniſter to aſſure men of Pardon upon their Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when he ſees ſuch lively ſigns of both (as moſt ſhew at the Lords Table) he may with Authority and Confidence, Requeſt Almighty God to forgive them, who in all likelyhood are come up to his own terms, as a Captain, when a beſieged Town hath yielded upon the Articles ſent by the General, may confidently require
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46235:75"/> him to ſeal them. Wherefore that holy Matron came to St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and deſired from him remiſſion of her ſins, and when he anſwered, God alone could do that, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I know that, and therefore I deſire the prayers of you his officer be preſented to him for me: and we read in Gods word of this petitionary abſolution<note n="(z)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 8.24. <hi>James</hi> 5.15.</note> which is ſomething more then the former, becauſe at the holy Sacrament the ſight of ſin is clearer, and the ſenſe quicker, and mens fear greater, ſo that then they need more comfort then to be told there is a Pardon, and they are then fit to receive more, becauſe there they ſhew more ſigns of Repentance. The third is Judiciary in the office for the ſick, and therein the Prieſt having declared there is a Pardon, and prayed for the ſick Perſon, doth by Gods authority, and as his ſubſtitute<note n="(a)" place="margin">Quantum in ſe eſt Sacramentum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliationis homini impendit.</note> declare him [whom he believes truly penitent] looſed from the guilt of his ſins by Chriſts merit. But this ſo high and ſolemn office is not by our Church preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be performed, but only to a weak or dying man, nor to him but upon his hearty confeſſion, and being full of fear and ſorrow, and when he ſhall deſire to hear his Pardon from the Prieſts mouth before he go to Gods tribunal: in ſuch caſe out of pity to this dejected ſoul, and to fortifie him againſt the agonies of death, upon evidences of true Repentance, this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution may be given; if the Prieſt be decieved<note n="(b)" place="margin">Deus non ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſequitur judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Eccleſiae quae per ſurreptionem &amp; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantiam interdu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> the man is no worſe, and if not, he is the better, by having the comfort of his Pardon anteda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his need. Now by all this it appears that our Church neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to give Abſolution, after the ſolemneſt manner in ſome caſes, as ſome among our ſelves have fancied, nor yet applyes that form to every Confeſſion, as the Romaniſts generally do, who never uſe the two firſt ſorts of Abſolution. To this brief account we ſhall add
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46235:76"/> theſe Conſiderations. 1. As for thoſe who think the Prieſt ought not to Abſolve any perſons, I think them groſly miſtaken: for if ſo then, why did Chriſt repeat this Commiſſion ſo often, are all thoſe lines wholly inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant; ſo you take them to be, who fancy this was a Perſonal priviledge dying with the Apoſtles; but the primitive Church did not ſo underſtand them, for it is eaſie to prove that Abſolutions were uſed frequently in the three firſt Centuries, and therefore why may not we uſe it now, ſince penitent ſinners need comfort now as well as any did then, and why ſhould the remedy ceaſe while the diſeaſe remains. Whence we conclude Chriſt gave the power of theſe Keys to all the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors: and St. <hi>Peter</hi> abſolved the penitent Jews<note n="(c)" place="margin">

Secondly as a ſhorter Creed and declaration of our Faith in the Trinity in Unity, which was the uſe it was fitted to afterwards: I wiſh we might have no occaſion to make uſe of it in the ſecond ſenſe as a Teſte for Hereticks (though the Diſciples of <hi>Socinus</hi> and Fanatick Enthuſiaſts do even ſtill deride or deny this miſtery) but if there were no ſuch it might ſtill ſerve its principal end, to be a Form of aſcribing all Praiſe and Glory to the Supreme Being, and an Act of Adoration to each Perſon, which we are obliged particularly to pay, becauſe every one of the Perſons in the Trinity hath done peculiar benefits for us; ſo that it is our Duty to Praiſe the Father for our Creation, the Son for our Redemption, the Holy Ghoſt for our Sanctification. The Father hath ſent us into the world and preſerves and provides for us in it. The Son hath lived with us and died for us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his Glory is ſtill mindful of us. The Holy Ghoſt doth come to us, and ſtay with us as a guard and a guide, a comforter and an advocate; cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds, cleanſing our hearts, quickening our affections, and enforcing our prayers: and ſhall we not then be highly ungrateful, if we pay not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tribute to every Perſon in ſpecial as well as to all in general: Remember the Angels ſung praiſe to the undivided and ever-bleſſed Trinity, in the morning of the Creation the beginning of all time<note n="(y)" place="margin">

Behold then, oh pious ſoul, a glorious Quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Heaven, with all holy Men and Women in all the world, at once with united voices and joyful hearts to ſing this triumphant Song, let this inſpire thee with holy raptures and extaſies of Devotion, to bear a part here on earth, and when thou art taken hence, thy place ſhall be ſupplied by the ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thou ſhalt be advanced to a ſtate as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as his mercy, where thou ſhalt praiſe him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. What better form can we have to glorifie God by then this, which is a declaration of our faith, a diſcharge of our homage, in which we acknowledge his former mercies, and confeſs his preſent favours to us and all the world, and glorifie him for both; we hope in him for thoſe that are to come, expecting all from him, and reſolving upon thoſe returns of Euchariſt which we will for ever make to him.

For all this I forbore them (as I have done you who ſerve me as they did) yet <hi>[fourty years long]</hi> I ſpared them from utter deſtruction, and ſtill they were as rebellious as at firſt, ſo that all that time <hi>[was I grieved with]</hi> the perverſeneſs of <hi>[this Generation]</hi> At laſt when nothing would amend them, I declared my utter deteſtation of them <hi>[and ſaid]</hi> of thoſe whom I had once choſen <hi>[it is a people]</hi> whom nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, a refractory crew <hi>[that do err in]</hi> the thoughts of <hi>[their hearts]</hi> concerning me, imagining me faithleſs and falſe, or weak and impotent, and no wonder <hi>[for they have not known]</hi> nor never would obſerve <hi>[my waies]</hi> to deſtroy preſumptuous ſinners, but to give grace and glory to holy and humble men, which put their truſt in me.</p>

               <p n="4">§. 4. Firſt it is neceſſary that we humbly and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call for the aſſiſtance of the Divine Spirit, which, as it did firſt indite, ſo it can beſt explain theſe Oracles of Truth, and alſo enable us to practice them. And this may be done by a ſhort and pathetical ejaculation, while the Miniſter prepares himſelf to Read, and if we are not ready at making ſuch Forms, we may repeat <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.180. <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things of thy Law:</hi> Or, <hi>ver.</hi> 125. <hi>I am thy ſervant give me underſtanding that I may know thy teſtimonies;</hi> Or if you have time you may pray by that excellent Collect [the ſecond in Order] for the ſecond Sunday of Advent: <hi>Bleſſed Lord God who haſt cauſed all holy Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> Now by theſe Prayers we own God the fountain of all Wiſdome, and expreſs our deſires to know and do his Will, and therefore no doubt they will procure us wiſdome and ſtrength.

Here is a Relation of his mean and humble birth, a record of his holy and afflicted life; a regiſter of his Miracles, a ſummary of his Sermons, and a moſt moving deſcription of his painful and Meritorious death. Let us therefore in hearing theſe Leſſons imagine our ſelves of his retinue, as if we were giving audience to his voice, or beholding his wonders of goodneſs and might. Let us carry our Pride to his Nativity, our idleneſs to his induſtrious doing good to all; our anger to his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; our revenge to his gentleneſs and love of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that they may bluſh and dye, when they ſee their deformity by ſo ſweet a pattern.

The ſervant of <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Royal and devout Maſter barefoot in a deep ſnow to a houſe of Prayer in a Winter night, when he began to tire, beheld his Prince, and with ſhame and love recruited his tired ſpirits, and every look gave him a new life: So would the ſight of Jeſus beget in us did we view him with that affection and ſteddineſs as we ought; if we have a due love for Chriſt, it will not only be pleaſant but profitable thus daily to hear of him. For his Sermons will convert us, his Converſation engage us to love him more, his Example will invite and enflame us, and his Death will above all tye our ſouls to him, and make our ſins as odious as the worſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that black cruelty: thus we may live like him, dye with him, and riſe again to newneſs of life. Laſtly, thoſe ſacred Epiſtles are uſed, which do further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Myſteries of the Divine Love, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, declaring Gods deſigns in it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from us, and the preparations made for us; with incomparable cautions againſt the deceits of Sathan, cruelty of Perſecutors, and falſhoods of hereticks, together with variety of Promiſes, Exhortations and Directions, ſo cloſely united, and ſo majeſtically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that it requires a quick apprehenſion, and a ſolid j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this rule muſt be obſerved by all in the Offices of Religion, when we hear Gods word that we do not purſue difficulties and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable diſputes, but apply the holy Scripture to profit by it. And certainly he beſt underſtands it who by it learns to bridle his paſſions, bound his deſires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his appetites, to fear God, love his neighbour, and to be careful of his own Immortal ſoul; and if we make this uſe of the words of God, we ſhall have

All the ſin-offerings of the law were but weak armor to encounter death, nor could they ſo fully purge or appeaſe the Conſcience, as that it ſhould not accuſe in the fatal hour: But the perfect Sacrifice of the death of Jeſus, doth ſo fully avert Gods wrath, that all that believe in him can triumph over death, meet it with courage, and embrace it with peace, as the end of their fears, and the entrance into their felicity<note n="(n)" place="margin">

He that knows Gods power, is perſuaded of his love, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his truth, can dye in peace, and lye down with joy in the aſſurance of a bleſſed Reſurrection. And this we may do, for it was only their priviledge who lived then, to ſee Jeſus, and whoever looked on

Why then are we ſo fixed to this world? ſo deſirous to ſtay? ſo loath to depart? ſo ſad when God calls? Oh let us look on this our Redeemer ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, and embrace him ſo tenderly in our hearts, that it may appear he is dearer to us then our very lives. Let us love him ſo intirely that nothing may ſatisfie us without him; and truſt ſo fully in his merits and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that we may live chearfully and dye peaceably. Let us ſay with this devout Old man; Lord I do now ſo clearly perceive thy purpoſes of mercy, ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe thy promiſes of forgiveneſs and ſo firmly rely on the hopes of glory, that I reſolve to be ever thy ſervant. I deſire to ſtay no longer in this world then to get aſſurances for a better. Earths vanities do not make me wiſh to live, nor deaths terrors afraid to dye. If thou calleſt me this day, Lord I come. I can live with patience, or dye in peace; for I ſee him that will preſerve me in life or death, and gives me hopes that whether I live or dye, I am the Lords. I was not with <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Temple to behold my Saviour with my bodily eyes; but I have had thy Salvation as clearly manifeſted in this thy holy word, as if I had ſeen him with my eyes. Lord grant me thy holy Spirit, that I may behold him with the ſame faith, and embrace him with the ſame affections that he did, and then I ſhall chearfully joyn in a <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> and being daily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye, ſhall ever be fit to live, and thy will ſhall be done in my life or death. Bleſſed Lord! thou haſt even to our dayes by theſe holy writings ſufficiently manifeſted thy Son before all our faces; and it is our careleſneſs, ingratitude and unbelief, that hides him from our eyes, and makes us hug theſe vanities, and fear to leave them. But thou haſt done thy part, and I will praiſe thee, for ſending this bright and glorious Sun, which ſhined on ſo many millions of wretched Heathens benighted in the darkneſs of Idolatry, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46235:159"/> made them Chriſtian. I will bleſs thee for honouring thy antient but deſpiſed people, who were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the birth of Jeſus, then by all their former Royalties and victorious Trophies; and inſtead of the bright Cloud, the glory of the Tabernacle, thou haſt ſent him to pitch his tent among them, who was the brightneſs of thy own glory. I am raviſhed to behold ſo many joyful ſouls bleſſing thee for this light which ſhined on them in their ſins, and the confines of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal darkneſs, and converted and tranſlated them into thy marvelous light. And all thy holy Saints in all ages have given thee the glory for all thoſe illuſtrious beams of Love and Charity, Piety, Juſtice and Devotion, which ſhine from their lives, and are but the reflexion of the rayes of the grace of Jeſus. This excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rejoyced not only in his own felicity, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold by the Spirit of Prophecy what joy Jeſus was like to bring to me, and many thouſands, of Converts and holy Men to the end of the World. Wherefore let us be glad and rejoyce with him, for our ſelves, and all people, for the light that ſhines upon us, and the glory that is round about us, and with all our Souls ſing, <hi>Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.</hi>

When we have proteſted our aſſurance that the eternal Son of God was made man, born among us, lived with us, and dyed for us, and aroſe again and returned to his glory to prepare a place for us, and plead our cauſe, can we then forbear to cry for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46235:166"/> and peace, for converſion and ſalvation? or ſhall we doubt to be accepted. Again, have we owned our belief of that holy Spirit which is the Author and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of all grace? and are we not then fitly diſpoſed and ſtrongly moved to petition for his aid, that we may continue true members of Chriſts body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Communion with the Saints, remiſſion of our ſins, reſtauration of our body, and an eternal life of glory? If we did not premiſe our Faith to our Prayers, it might be ſuſpected we ſpoke to him we knew not, and asked what was unfit to be deſired or impoſſible to be obtained. But now all theſe ſtumbling blocks are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and our Creed is made an excellent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the following Collects; every Petition of which are directed by, grounded on, and enforced from ſome of theſe Articles, which, if we thus apply them, will ſhew us, how fitly we may deſire theſe things, and what reaſon we have to hope they ſhall be granted. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly we muſt learn to apply theſe Articles of our Faith to the right ordering of our lives, not repeating them as empty notions and airy ſpeculations, but as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and rules of practice. For why ſhould the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans belief alone be ſuppoſed ſufficient, without ſome Acts deduced from it.

The Countryman ſows, the Scholar ſtudies, and the Souldier fights according to the principles of advantage they believe will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe endeavours. And doth the Religious man only believe and ſit ſtill? Are not our principles ſurer, our hopes clearer, and our probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities fairer, and our gains like to be infinitely more? Why then do we ſay theſe principles over as it were ſome Leſſon that was never to be put in practice? Let us turn our Creed into Syllogiſms, and we ſhall ſee what conſequences neceſſarily flow from it. And let us ſo
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46235:167"/> firmly believe it that our Converſation may be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concluſion from thoſe premiſes; for there is no man whoſe natural Logick will not enable him to argue thus. He that believes God to be Almighty, and that he made him and all the world, muſt love and fear this God and truſt in him in all his needs: But <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I muſt love and fear and truſt in him at all times. Or thus, Whoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and fears Gods wrath, cannot truly believe Jeſus came to ſave him from it, but he muſt ſpeedily apply himſelf to him, and thankfully embrace this ſalvation: But I who deſerve and fear Gods wrath do believe this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore I muſt ſpeedily apply my ſelf to him, and thankfully embrace this ſalvation from him. And thus without ſtrictly confining our ſelves to the rules of Art, the moſt ignorant may with a little conſideration find the natural reſult of every Article, and what effect it will produce in any man that heartily doth embrace it. And oh that all the world were as willing to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their profeſſions, as they are able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the force of theſe arguings! We ſhould not ſee our practiſes ſo frequently oppoſite to (nay deſtructive of) thoſe principles we pretend to believe. Let us ask our ſelves what manner of perſons we ought to be, who do ſo ſolemnly proteſt our belief that all theſe things are true. In temporal things, what we believe dangerous and unprofitable we avoid; what we are perſuaded is pleaſant and advantageous we purſue; and if our aſſent be as firm, why ſhould we not do ſo in ſpirituals? Where the grounds are ſurer, the inferences clearer, and the gain and reward infinitely greater: 'tis too much to be feared we follow not our Creed far enough, nor conſider what the belief of thoſe Articles would produce in us if cordially embraced. Wherefore for the ſake of ſuch as could not, or would not thus uſe the Articles of their Faith; we have added to the Paraphraſe the following Application.</p>

               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10, 11. <hi>O God make clean our hearts within us:</hi> Anſw. <hi>And take not thy holy ſpirit from us.]</hi> Though Peace be accounted the chief of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, yet without grace it may do us more harm then good. Wherefore we conclude with an carneſt ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Grace to fit us for, and help us in, the following devotions. We are now to offer up our incenſe and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do beſeech the Author and lover of purity in holy <hi>Davids</hi> words, to cleanſe the Altars of our hearts, that neither the guilt of former offences may unhallow or defile them, nor any remaining evil thoughts may diſturb the holy cloud; but that it may aſcend and he a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour before the Throne of God. And becauſe it is the Holy Spirit alone which can effect this, we pray that our hearts may be ſo pure as to invite this holy Dove to come unto us, and remain with us, that it may both make and keep us undefiled both in the remaining part of our Prayers and of our lives. If we look back on thoſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Office which we have performed, I hope we ſhall have cauſe thankfully to acknowledge that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit hath been with us, and excited the flames of our devotion, the comfort of which aid makes us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for its continuance. And certainly we could never have ſent up theſe very ſacred ejaculations with ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſpirits, united hearts, and harmonious voices, if the ſame ſpirit of zeal and love had not inſpired us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the ſweetneſs of this experience encourage us to beg that the Holy Ghoſt may ſtay among us, ſo that we may as affectionately joyn in thoſe Prayers where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is the only ſpeaker, as we have done in theſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have had the honour and advantage of bearing our Parts, and making our Reſponſals.</p>

And yet the Epiſtle and Goſpel annexed to them are generally an excellent Commentary upon them; and ſome judge they take their name from their being <hi>Collected</hi> out of thoſe portions of holy Writ.

We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt either his ſufficiency, his might or his mercy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no cauſe to fear but this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall prevail. We are on Earth, but we have a Father in Heaven, we are weak, but our Lord is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; our time is meaſured by daies and nights, and we grow older every day, and muſt at length have our end; but we have a God that changeth not, but is the ſame from everlaſting to everlaſting.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46235:184"/> were folded in the arms of ſleep the brother of death, and were inſenſible of danger, and uncapable of reſiſtance; yet we have gone ſafe through thoſe diſmal ſhades, which are the image of hell, the embleme of death, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of miſchief, and the moſt uncomfortable part of our lives. And though the Heathens ſuppoſed the Dominion of the Night to belong to the Infernal Powers, yet we have found it is under the government of our heavenly Father, by whoſe gracious providence, we have been kept therein from the malice of Sathan, and the deſigns of evil men, ſafe in ſoul and body. Yea he hath made it a refreſhment of our wearineſs, an allay of our care, and a renewing of our ſtrength, ſo that perhaps we ſcarce apprehended the terrors nor tediouſneſs of it. And are we not unworthy to live another day, if all this will not fill our hearts and mouths with Euchariſt and thankful acknowledgments to him that never ſlumbers nor ſleeps? who hath ſo ſafely brought us to the morning light, and given us an earneſt of our reſurrection? And this ſincere gratitude will be not only the diſcharge of a duty to God, but an occaſion of benefit to our ſelves. For he that heartily praiſeth God every morning for the renewed mercies it brings with it, may more chearfully ask, and more reaſonably expect, the continuance of the ſame Providence in the day following.

                     </gap>efence, without which we had not eſcaped the terrors of the laſt night, nor can we but by it be ſecured againſt the dangers of this day. The light perhaps may make us
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46235:185"/> more confident, but we are often leſs ſafe: for in the day time we have Company to diſturb us, buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare us, occaſions and opportunities to entice us; we have more temptations, and greater variety of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and occurrences, and yet commonly we are but ſlenderly guarded againſt all the miſchiefs which we are expoſed unto; but we had need buckle on our armor, and beware that haſte or negligence do not thruſt us into the battail naked, before we have put on thoſe pieces of defence by Prayer, which God hath provided for us. If we view the way in which we are to walk, we may diſcern ſo many pits digged, and traps ſet for us, that we who are by nature blind, and by cuſtome careleſs, are never likely to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cape them, unleſs we be guided by an all-ſeeing eye, and guarded by an almighty power. Say therefore every morning moſt paſſionately, Lord we ſhall either fall into the pits of temptation which Sathan hath cunningly covered over, or run into the traps of danger which are ſecretly laid for us on every ſide; ſo that if thy preſence go not along with us, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us not any further<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15.</note>. Let us not dare to ruſh into the midſt of temptations, till we have earneſtly begged wiſdome to diſcover, courage to reſiſt, and ſtrength to overcome all the ſins by which we may be allured; remembring that ſin doth diſpleaſe our God, deſtroy our Hopes, diſquiet our Conſciences, and lay us open to all miſchiefs, even the leaſt of ſins hath theſe malignant qualities in it, beſides that it makes way for a greater. We muſt expect to be tempted, in privacy and in company, in our buſineſs and recreations, our meat and drink, nay our charity and devotions. But we muſt every morning pray that we may not in leſſer or greater inſtances conſent to theſe evil motions, that we may not fall into any ſin by compliance, nor lye in and under it by impenitence; And we may be aſſured Gods grace is ſufficient thus to defend us. Only let us beware we do not abuſe this neceſſary Petition, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Companions in, and occaſions of ſin before night; for if we be not watchful to avoid evil, as well
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46235:185"/> as earneſt in calling for the Divine aid, we do but mock the Deity whoſe help we call for, and our actions ſhew our Petitions were but feigned. But oh! with what a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene mind, and an active hope, ſhall they perform their evening ſacrifice, and lay themſelves down to reſt, whoſe Conſcience teſtifies they have as ſtudiouſly avoided all wilful ſin throughout the whole day, as they did ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pray againſt it in the morning. And that we may do ſo, let us place ſin before danger, both in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and in our Opinions: becauſe that only harms the body, but this hurts the ſoul. Let the Order of this ſentence teach us that ſin is the greateſt evil in the world: and if it cannot be avoided but we muſt fall into one of theſe, we muſt chooſe danger rather then ſin: for if by avoiding of iniquity we are caſt upon the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any evil, or looſing any good; we muſt account ſuch reproach our honour, ſuch poverty our riches, and ſuch loſs our trueſt gain, and we ſhall be eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for it. This may be our caſe ſometimes, but commonly the flying of ſin doth not involve us in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but ſecure us from it; and wickedneſs is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to miſchief. Drunkenneſs and luſt, pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, injuſtice and deceit, do naturally lead thoſe who follow them into many perils, and as well theſe as all other ſins do cauſe God to take away his protecting hand from us, and then we are not many ſteps from ruine, although his juſtice ſhould not inflict any poſitive evils for theſe offences. And therefore if we would be ſafe we muſt be holy. We are apt to be more ſenſible and fearful of ſickneſs then ſin, of the danger to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rather then inward man: but ſince they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of one another, we muſt pray againſt both. And if we fear diſeaſes or want, reproach or wrong, violence or death, let thoſe very fears quicken our petitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, which is the gate that lets them all in upon us. We may fall into calamities by the immediate hand of Providence, but when by acts of wickedneſs we bring them upon our ſelves, we are ſaid to <hi>Run into danger,</hi> and this we chiefly pray againſt here, that we may not by our own folly and iniquity become acceſſary to our
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46235:186"/> own miſery; for ſuch afflictions will not be ſo likely to be ſanctified, ſo eaſie to be born, nor ſo poſſible to be removed.

And it is not our performances but the effects of his own grace that he approves of. Nor yet doth he count them righteous for any merit that is in the works or the perſons doing them, but through the merits and obedience of the Holy Jeſus, in whoſe name we therefore make this Prayer, not expecting our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications can be heard, or our actions juſtified for their own worth, but through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: deſiring he will pleaſe by his interceſſion and merits ſo to recommend our Perſons and Devotions, that we

                  <head>A Practical Diſcourſe on this Collect for Peace.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>O God from whom all holy deſires all good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and all juſt works do proceed]</hi> This Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect hath the ſame title, and ſeems to have the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with that in the morning Office. And indeed Peace is ſo deſirable a bleſſing that we cannot pray for it too often, eſpecially if it be for different kinds of Peace, as it is in the preſent caſe if we well obſerve it. In the Morning we pray for external, in the evening for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace. In the beginning of the day being to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch various affairs and converſe with the world, we deſire to be preſerved from the injuries, affronts, and deſigns of evil men: In the cloſe thereof we requeſt that tranquility of mind that ſprings from the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, that when our hearts lye as eaſie as our heads, our ſleep may be ſweet and quiet. The firſt kind of Peace ſometimes the beſt of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain, for the wicked will do wickedly; but even then this inward peace will ſupport us, and make a calm within when the waves beat moſt furiouſly from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. So that this is the moſt neceſſary and moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. Wherefore we are taught to ask this (which is called the Peace of God) from the God of peace, who is here deſcribed to us as the author and finiſher of all holineſs and righteouſneſs, the ſureſt and only foundations for a true and laſting peace. From which we may learn that there is an inſeparable union between righteouſneſs and true peace<note n="(z)" place="margin">Fac justitiam &amp; habebis pacem; tu fortè unam habere vis, alteram non vis — at oſculantur hae amant hae: ſi amicam pacis non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maveris, non amabit te pax. <hi>Aug.</hi> Pſal. <hi>85.10.</hi>

                     </note>, the ſcorn, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the world, can hinder the ſerene reflexions and inward Peace of a good conſcience. He that doth not deſerve reproach can nobly deſpiſe it: and he that hath not provoked his neighbour to wrong him by any evil doing, can eaſily bear the greateſt of injuries. Whereas if all the world be quiet and none diſturb the wicked man, he makes himſelf reſtleſs<note n="(b)" place="margin">Si in mundo non eſt quod timeant, pacem habere putan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; ſed pax ista cum conſcientia ſemper litigat, rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur intrinſecus, &amp; cum hostem non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, ſecum decertat. <hi>Caſſiodor.</hi> in Pſal.</note> becauſe there is an enemy within that upbraids him more loudly, and wounds him more deeply then he can do the holy man.

                  <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Give unto thy Servants that Peace which the world cannot give]</hi> To ask a thing inconſiderable of a mighty prince may ſeem a diſparagement, becauſe he can as eaſily beſtow a province on a faithful Servant, as another can give a ſmall gratuity. So when we that are the Servants of the moſt high make our Petitions, it muſt be for ſuch things as are not in our power, nor in the power of any other to beſtow. Our requeſts muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his infinite bounty rather then our deſerts. We muſt ask ſomething which may become his Majeſty to give, that our Lord may be glorified by the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of his Servants. We now deſire peace, but it is ſuch a Peace as no other hand can diſpenſe: a Peace, that is not given as the world gives, in a feigned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement or an empty wiſh at beſt<note n="(g)" place="margin">John <hi>14.27.</hi> Homines plerumque frigidae tantum Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniae cauſâ pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem in ore habent; vel ſi pacem alicui ſeriò precantur, non tamen cam reipſâ dare poſſunt. <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>
                     </note> but in ſincerity and with effect; a peace, differing from the worlds Peace, in its nature, cauſes and Qualities, in all which it far excels it. This Peace is grounded on the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Faith in that reconciliation which the merits of Jeſus have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured<note n="(h)" place="margin">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46235:190"/> ſatisfaction therein; and ſuch fixed expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternal glory thereby, that no raviſhments are comparable to the pleaſures of it. And then it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfirmed by the teſtimony of a good<note n="(i)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</note> conſcience, declaring we have endeavoured to walk anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this infinite love, by a ſtrict obſervance of all the will of God: which occaſions ſuch a pleaſing calm in our ſouls, and creates ſo brisk a delight in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very review, that no tongue can tell the joy of ſuch ſouls, but only theirs that feel it. This is the Peace which is ſo ſweet and ſo unmixed, ſo charming and powerful, that no ſinful pleaſures can entice, nor no earthly calamities force a holy man from the embraces of it. The Peace of the world, if it ſpring from the friendſhip and love of men, hath innumerable allays. For this is ſometimes no more but guilded flattery, and a cover for more unexpected and dangerous aſſaults. But if true, it can neither ſupport you under, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you againſt the anger of God, and muſt dye when the firſt of you two lovers deſcends to the grave. If it ariſe from plenty, it will make your delights worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to remember how quickly you may be ſtript of them; what excellent things you have given for them, and how ſpeedily you muſt be taken from them, however your peace and plenty muſt expire together. Give us then O Lord that Peace which is grounded on thy truth, and the merits of Jeſus: upon a ſenſe of thy love and an experience of thy grace; for this can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor fail us, becauſe it ends in everlaſting Peace. And let us not ſeek this in the Freindſhips of the wicked nor the ſtorehouſes of pleaſure; but in Jeſus and an holy life, in heavenly deſires, pious reſolutions and religious Converſation. In which the grace of God will help us, for we are his ſervants and make our applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him for it; and ſince we ſeek not as the world ſeeks, no doubt we ſhall find a Peace ſo ſweet and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that nothing which the men of this World know can be compared to it.</p>

Which we ought earneſtly to deſire for our own ſakes becauſe it is our concern the Supream power ſhould be alwaies vigorous and ſafe, proſperous and abounding in all plenty, that he may be a terrour to his enemies, and a defence to his loving and loyal ſubjects. In his ſafety we are ſafe, his health and wealth enables him to ſecure us in that which is ours; ſince his ſtrength, and his time, his treaſures and his power are imployed and expended for the common good. And becauſe changes are alwayes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſometimes deſtructive to a Nation, we pray that our King may be long preſerved in his gracious Reign over us.

And as we are members of the Church as well as the State, we muſt pray for thoſe things which are requiſite to the preſervation and felicity of both joyntly and ſeverally, ſince they mutually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other. And as the union of men into Polities and civil Societies, is deſigned for the ſecuring our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Eſtates, and the obtaining of external proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo the union of Chriſtians, by one Spirit into one Faith, and to one another by the bonds of love, is intended by God for the edification of our ſouls, and the ſecuring our eternal inheritance.

The Introduction ſets God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in thoſe admirable Attributes and wonderful Works, which declare him every way fit to be called upon for his Church, and mind us what he hath done for it. It is he that firſt gathered his Church out of obſtinate Jews and ignorant Heathens by his Almighty Power; and who hath by the ſame Omnipotence either preſerved it from, or ſupported it againſt, the malice of Sathan, the rage of Perſecutors, the ſubtility of Hereticks, and the blind zeal of factious Dividers: ſo that it continues to this very day, and ſhall do to the end of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Redeemer ever lives to intercede for us, and hath promiſed to be with us<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. <hi>16.18.</hi> chap. <hi>28.</hi> ver. ult.

                  </head>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>ALmighty God who haſt given us grace at this time with one accord, to make our common ſupplications unto thee]</hi> This excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of our prayers that bears the name of its renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author, was well known to the Greek Church; for it is ſtill found extant in the Lyturgies both of St. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> And yet its own worth might ſufficiently recommend it, if it wanted the reputation of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Names. For it is founded on our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the certainty of his Promiſe who is infallible; carried on with ſuch ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will, and deſigned ſo to our chiefeſt advantages, that nothing can be more judiciouſly contrived, or more pertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this cloſe of our Devotion. Where it ſeems to review and re-enforce all our former Petitions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our hopes of acceptance and encourage our zeal in them, yet ſo as to repreſent our neceſſities in the moſt humble and lowly manner, with ſubmiſſion to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who beſt knows what is moſt expedient for us. We may now reflect on thoſe many neceſſary and uſeful Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which we have offered up to God with an unanimous conſent and a hearty Devotion; and it is fit we ſhould pay our grateful acknowledgments for that Grace which hath aſſiſted us therein. For there are no clearer evidences of the preſence of the Divine Spirit in our Prayers then the ſincere agreement and harmonious accord of our ſouls in the joynt oblation of them<note n="(u)" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> and the fervent affections that every one in particular hath added to them. It is his Grace that hath bound our arrows together by the bonds of love, and hath directed them to pierce the Clouds by a vigorous and ſteddy zeal. And we have the ſurer ground to believe he hath aſſiſted us, and the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46235:212"/> greater cauſe to praiſe him for it, in regard theſe are no other then our Common Prayers and ordinary Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have no novelties or varieties to court our Fancies, but yet have been made new to us by a freſh ſupply of his heavenly grace, which hath kindled our accuſtomed ſacrifice with new flames. And if we well conſider, the effects of Gods grace are rather to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heart then the tongue, by renewed affections rather then change of expreſſions. And to be ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a new ſenſe of our old wants, can give life to theſe Petitions. Wherefore as we daily receive new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, let us daily make new acknowledgments; that as we have the comfort of our union and zeal, ſo he who beſtows them may have the glory. And yet this is not all the uſe we muſt make of the experience which we have had of his enabling us to pray; for it muſt ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, and quicken our hope that we ſhall be heard. For he that helps us to ask, thereby aſſures us he intends to give<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</note>. He prepares the heart and then his ear attends thereunto. The firſt ſtep towards the obtaining of a bleſſing, is the giving us a heart devoutly to ask for it<note n="(y)" place="margin">Signum futurae impetrationis est, quando Spiritus S. movet ad petendam cum fiduciâ &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi ſecuritate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trandi. <hi>Caſſian. coll. 9.</hi>
                     </note>. Which deſire he would not create if he did not intend to fulfil it. Therefore we may lay this as a foundation on which we may chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully requeſt his gracious acceptance of thoſe Prayers which he hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us to by a new Devotion.</p>

When they are backed with his promiſe they cannot fail. Who would not lay aſide all occaſions and run every day to meet with Jeſus who is ſure to be found in the Temple? And who would not love theſe Devotions in which ſo many thouſands do agree? And who (that believes the truth of Jeſus) can doubt of a gracious return to them?

The legal Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was no more but a wiſh for temporal felicity: but this contains the whole order of our ſalvation, and brings in the glorious Trinity with the ſeveral gifts of each Perſon to make us compleatly happy. The Father indeed is firſt in order, but we begin with the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is, the benefits purchaſed by his Paſſion; becauſe that is the firſt mover in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and obtains both the love of God the Father, and the Communication of the Holy Ghoſt. What can the pious ſoul ask or deſire which is not comprehended in this Bleſſing? here is the grace of the Son to pardon our ſin, the love of the Father to ſupply our wants, the fellowſhip of the Bleſſed Spirit to ſtrengthen our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The firſt to redeem us, the ſecond to juſtifie us, the third to ſanctifie us: and all theſe not only at this preſent, but to be confirmed to us, and remain with us, even when we are gone from the holy place, in life and death and for ever. Nor are theſe only deſired, but they are pronounced over us by the Embaſſador of God, whom he hath ſent to bleſs in his name: and this Miniſter of Heaven being cheared with obſerving our Devotion, doth from his ſoul wiſh, and Miniſterially (as far as in him lies) diſpenſe theſe unſpeakable bleſſings to us. And what he doth on Earth ſhall be ratified in Heaven to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very truly holy man. Oh let us bow our heads and open our hearts to receive this univerſal bleſſing as from God himſelf, and depart from the holy place full of comfort and joy, that we have ſuch a preſervative againſt all evil, and ſuch a guide and encouragement to all good, even the bleſſing of God to be with us and remain upon us for ever: and to this let all the people ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
